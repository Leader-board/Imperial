# Imperial Panopto downloader

## What this does

Mass-downloads videos from a playlist (such as lectures for a module). 

To give more detail: Imperial provides an option to download an individual lecture video using Panopto, but this can easily be tedious when one wants to download _all_ lectures for a particular module (since the option to download them all at once isn't provided). This script automates that process. 

## Instructions

You'll need chromedriver. Adjust the script appropriately.

If you do not already have Chrome, install it and then login to Imperial on Chrome, choosing the option to remember preferences when asked. This ensures that the script can download the videos without having to bother you for the credentials. 

Each folder represents a module (playlist), and it is hence easy to download all videos of multiple modules in one go.
