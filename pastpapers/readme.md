## The Past Papers repository

### What this is

A collection of past papers for various subjects, along with some grade data wherever possible (such as the average grades or scaling data). 

### How were they obtained?

As far as possible, WhatDoTheyKnow. That is preferred as it means that these papers are public. 
For EIE, from the already crowd-sourced resources. For CS, from exams.doc.ic.ac.uk. 

Contribution of these papers are welcome - just file a GitHub Issue. 

### Exclusion notes

It is not possible to provide all past years' papers for CS and Physics as they provide theirs under a lock. Hence, for CS I've only added papers up to 2004 or so, and one year's past paper for Physics. The aim is to provide as much as possible without possibily falling foul of some rule or other.
