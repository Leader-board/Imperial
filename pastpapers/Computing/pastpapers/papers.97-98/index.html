<h1> 
Examination Papers 1998 </h1> 

<P>All 1997-98 exam papers set within the Department of Computing (with the
exception of ISE-only papers) have been scanned in and made available as pdf
files.  You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 to read them.  This is installed on
all the Linux and Windows NT systems in the teaching labs.</P>

<P>We used a new scanning system this year.  
Thanks are due to: Frank Kriwaczek for his help and advice, 
to Chris Hogger for creating the Web pages,
to Mark Dawson, Niranjan Jayasundera, Christos Stergiou and Robert Chatley
from CSG for purchasing and configuring the equipment,
to Teresa Sergot, Barbara Claxton and Andy Davies.</P>

<P>You may find that the quality when viewed on screen is not very good,
though it should be adequate if you increase the magnification. 
Nevertheless the print quality should be fine.</P>

<P>You may wonder why the papers are scanned in and made available as gifs. 
This is because the printed papers are produced by a variety of means, and so 
this is the only systematic way to guarantee a complete set of papers which are exactly as set.</P>
