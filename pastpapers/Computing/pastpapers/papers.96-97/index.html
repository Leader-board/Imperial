<h1> 
Examination Papers 1997 </h1> 

<P>All 1996-97 exam papers set within the Department of Computing (with the
exception of ISE-only papers) have been scanned in and made available as pdf
files.  You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 to read them.  This is installed on
all the UNIX teaching machines.  It is not currently available on either the macs
or PCs.</P>

<P>Note only three of the five laser printers in the Teaching Labs are capable of
printing pdf files. These are the printers in rooms 203, 208 and 219. The
printers in rooms 206 and 207 do not support Level 2 PostScript, and will only
print an error sheet.</P>

<P> Thanks to Frank Kriwaczek for his help and advice and for creating the pdf
files, to Chris Hogger for creating the Web pages, to Keith Sephton for
installing Acrobat Reader, and to Maureen Munday for doing the scanning.</P>

<P>Papers 1.1-1.9 and 2.1-2.12 will be available on paper from the SGO,
priced &#163 1.50.  The 1995 papers have not been scanned, and
will continue to be available from the SGO.</P>

<P>You may find that the quality when viewed on screen is not very good,
though it should be adequate if you increase the magnification. 
Nevertheless the print quality should be fine.</P>

<P>You may wonder why the papers are scanned in and made available as gifs.  This is because the printed papers are produced by a variety of means, and so this is the only systematic way to guarantee a complete set of papers which are exactly as set.</P>
